# Pokemon App

This is a simple web application developed for my fullstack classes that displays a list of Pokemon from the PokeAPI, allowing users to view details about each Pokemon.

## Usage

To view the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click on a Pokemon's name to view its image and height in a modal window.
